# Project-Landing-Page
This project is one that will test my ability to copy the structure of a web page using the knowledge gained from The Odin Project, and the last project for the CSS section. 

This project demostrates my ability to develop the html structure of the page, and be able to organize the layout using CSS. The main tool used for the layout is the use of flexbox.

This type of web page is, according to TOP, an excellent design that can be used for a professional business. It is clean, organized and easy to follow.

I hope my efforts to transpose the desired product meet the expectations of the makers of TOP, but also myself. I may expand on this project in the future to create my own design. I hope it may show some of my skill as a future front-end developer.
